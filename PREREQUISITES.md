# Prerequisites

1. ``python``
    -  [Windows installer](https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/) - either 2.7.x or 3.5.x is fine
        * If you're prompted to "Add Python to PATH", yes please enable it.
        * I cannot vouch for the accuracy of these guides, but they look pretty okay as reference.
            - [Setting up Python in Windows 10](http://www.anthonydebarros.com/2015/08/16/setting-up-python-in-windows-10/)
            - [Setting up Python in Windows 8.1](http://www.anthonydebarros.com/2014/02/16/setting-up-python-in-windows-8-1/)
            - [Setting up Python in Windows 7](http://www.anthonydebarros.com/2011/10/15/setting-up-python-in-windows-7/)
    -  MacOS/Linux should have it installed by default
2. ``git``
    - [Windows installer](https://git-for-windows.github.io/)
        * After installation, test if you can run ``git --version`` in the command line. If you can't, you will need to edit the environmental variable PATH to include the path to your git install. Please google.
    - MacOS:
        * If you have brew: ``brew install git``
        * Alternatively, search for "XCode command line tools" in the App store and install that.
3. [``ffmpeg``](https://ffmpeg.org/)
    - [Windows installer](https://ffmpeg.zeranoe.com/builds/)
    - [MacOS installer](https://evermeet.cx/ffmpeg/)
